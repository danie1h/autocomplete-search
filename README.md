## About

This SPA features an autocomplete search feature to find various types of financial companies and information. Users have the ability to filter their search by financial company type:

* Bank
* Credit Card
* Investment
* Loan
* Mortgage

Based on a users search criteria, the company name, resource(url) and type will return as output.

## Demo

A live demo of the project can be viewed [here](https://danie1h.github.io/autocomplete-search/).

## Tech-Stack

* HTML
* CSS
* React (create-react-app)

## Methodology

For this project I decided to undergo an agile methodology where I planned and tracked my tasks using Trello. Project plans can be observed [here](https://trello.com/b/JTOn9g2U/autocomplete-search). There are additional features listed out on Trello that are yet to be implemented.

## Known Bugs

1. ~~Searching with parenthesis. Details: If a user enters a '(' or ')' an error is thrown~~

2. Dropdown does not update. Details: If there is one character entered in the search bar and the user presses backspace, the dropdown is still displayed

3. ~~Filter options are all in uppercase and/or contain '_'.~~
